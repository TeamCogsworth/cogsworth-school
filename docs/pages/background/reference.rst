Useful reference material
=========================

As you're working through some of the labs, it might be useful to have some of this reference material handy.

``cogsworth``
-------------
For more information on ``cogsworth``, please see the following. The lab will cover everything you need to know to get started, but these links might be useful for further reading.

- `cogsworth documentation <https://cogsworth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `cogsworth GitHub repository <https://github.com/TomWagg/cogsworth>`_
- `cogsworth paper <https://scixplorer.org/abs/2025ApJS..276...16W/abstract>`_

Population synthesis
--------------------

Rapid binary population synthesis is a way of simulating the evolution of large populations of binary stars using approximate prescriptions for complex physical processes. Here are some useful links to learn more about population synthesis in general, and some of the codes that ``cogsworth`` builds upon.

- ``cogsworth`` uses ``COSMIC`` for population synthesis by default.
    - `COSMIC documentation <https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/COSMIC/>`_
    - `COSMIC paper <https://scixplorer.org/abs/2020ApJ...898...71B/abstract>`_
- ``COSMIC`` in turn builds upon the ``BSE`` and ``SSE`` codes developed by Hurley et al, which were introduced in these papers:
    - `SSE paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000MNRAS.315..543H/abstract>`_
    - `BSE paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.329..897H/abstract>`_
