How do I interpret this output??
================================

``cogsworth`` generates a lot of different outputs. The full documentation explains this in detail, but something that will come up a lot is interpreting the output tables from population synthesis (which is coming from ``COSMIC`` by default).

I'm not going to go into full detail here (you can check out this `cogsworth tutorial <https://cogsworth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/outputs.html>`_ for that), but I just wanted to highlight this section of the ``COSMIC`` docs that you'll often need.
