Preparing for the labs
======================

Hi there! Before starting the labs, please follow these instructions to set up your coding environment so you're ready to go on the day!

Install ``cogsworth``
---------------------

You can follow the instructions in the ``cogsworth`` documentation to install the code on your machine. If you have any issues, please don't hesitate to ask for help!

    Go to installation instructions

Download the lab materials
--------------------------

Some of the parts of the lab would require you to run large simulations. We'll avoid this by employing a "here's one I made earlier" approach, where you can download the outputs of these simulations and use them to follow along with the lab. You can download these materials using the link below.
